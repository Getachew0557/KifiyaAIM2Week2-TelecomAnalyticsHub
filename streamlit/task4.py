    Customer satisfaction is a crucial aspect of business success. It is influenced by both user engagement and experience. This analysis aims to evaluate customer satisfaction based on these factors and involves multiple tasks, including scoring, clustering, regression modeling, and deployment tracking.

    st.subheader('Task 4.2: Calculate and Report Satisfaction Scores')
    st.write("""
    Calculated the satisfaction score as the average of engagement and experience scores. Reported the top 10 most satisfied customers based on these scores.

    st.subheader('Task 4.3: Build and Evaluate Regression Model')
    st.write("""
    Built a regression model to predict customer satisfaction scores. Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
